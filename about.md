I am a first year PhD student studying at the University of Cambridge. 

My interests lie largely within the scope of Quantum Information and Computation. In particular, I am interested in ways of simulating quantum systems using quantum computers.

The name of this site is inspired by the nickname ("non sequitur") bestowed upon me by my A-Level Math's teacher for my highly tangential questions and comments.
